For the following questions, assume:

	- A 12-bit successive approximation analog-to-digital converter (SAR A/D), just like in the Edison Arduino expansion board
	- running via a 1 MHz clock
	- capable of measuring 6 channels through a multiplexer
	- using an analog reference, Vref, of 3.3V relative to a 0V ground

1.  A measurement of 0V corresponds to what digital (binary) value?  Write your answer in binary, hexadecimal and decimal.
    binary: 0000 0000 0000
    hexadecimal: 00h
    decimal: 0

2. A measurement of 3.3V corresponds to what digital (binary) value?  Write your answer in binary, hexadecimal and decimal.
    binary: 1111 1111 1111
    hexadecimal: 0xFFF
    decimal: 4095


3. A measurement of 5V corresponds to what digital (binary) value?  Write your answer in binary, hexadecimal and decimal.
    binary: 1111 1111 1111
    hexadecimal: 0xFFF
    decimal: 4095



4. What is the resolution of this A/D converter?  i.e. what is the difference in volts, between measurements that differ by only 1 bit?
    #volts / 2^(# of bits)
    
    (3.3 - 0) / (2^(12)-1)
    .80586mV


5. Walk through a complete measurement for a Vin of 1.28 V.  Show all steps leading to the measured binary value.
             1.28V
            
    0x800 -> 1.65V > val (times value from #4)
    0x400 -> .825V < val
    0x600 -> 1.2378V < val
    0x700 -> 1.444V > val
    0x680 -> 1.34095V > val
    0x640 -> 1.2893V > val
    0x620 -> 1.26359V < val
    0x630 -> 1.27648V < val
    0x638 -> 1.2829V > val
    0x634 -> 1.2797V < val
    0x636 -> 1.2813V > val
    0x635 -> 1.2805V > val   
   
    Answer:
    0x634 -> 1.2797V (1588 int)
    error of .293V


6. How many clock cycles did question 5 take?  How many seconds is this?

    each bit takes a clock cycle
    T = 1/f     1/1E6
    12microseconds


7. What is the error associated with your answer from question 5?

    .293mV


8. If that error was in measuring acceleration as in Lab 2, what is the error in "gee"?

    


9. If we wanted to make A/D measurements on 6 channels (like measuring X,Y,Z axes for two different sensors), how long would it take to make all 6 measurements?  

    6 x 12microseconds = 72 microseconds


10. Texas Instruments' PCM1802 stereo analog-to-digital converter measures 2 analog signals (Left and Right audio from a microphone for example) with a resolution of 24 bits.  If a pre-amplifier is used to amplify the small voltages produced by the microphone, the input voltage to the A/D is 2V peak to peak, meaning it goes from -2V to +2V. Sample rate is 96kHz.   What is the resolution of this A/D in volts?  What is this in terms of the "quantization dynamic range" in decibels?  Dynamic range can be calculated as 20 * log_10(Vmax/deltaV), where Vmax is the maximum range of measurement and deltaV is the smallest voltage measurable.  If you know anything about audio, is that good?

    loudest thing can measure to the softest thing
    20 log10(difference)
    144 dB
    
    human ear can do difference of 130 dB
